#CSpec 
 
CSpec is a small behavior driven development ([BDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)) framework for C. You can read more about BDD on www.behaviour-driven.org

##A Small Example

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <cspecs/cspec.h>

context (example) {

    describe("Describe the example") {

        it("true should be equal true") {
            should_bool(true) be equal to(true);
        } end

        it("true shouldn't be equal to false") {
            should_bool(true) not be equal to(false);
        } end

        it("this test will fail because 10 is not equal to 11") {
            should_int(10) be equal to(11);
        } end

        skip("this test will fail because \"Hello\" is not \"Bye\"") {
            should_string("Hello") be equal to("Bye");
        } end

    } end

}
```

* Compile: `gcc cspecExample.c -o cspecExample -lcspecs`
* Execute: `./cspecExample`

```

  Describe the example
    ✔ true should be equal true
    ✔ true shouldn't be equal to false
    1) this test will fail because 10 is not equal to 11
    • this test will fail because "Hello" is not "Bye"


  Summary

    1) Describe the example - this test will fail because 10 is not equal to 11
      - Expected <11> but was <10> [./cspecExample.c:18]

  2 success
  1 failure
  1 pending

```

##Lets get started!
###¿How do i install it?
1. `git clone https://github.com/pepita-remembrance/cspec.git`
1. `cd cspec`
1. `make`
1. `sudo make install`

###Now, ¿What should i do?
* Write your C code
* Test it with this framework, don't forget to compile it with the `-lcspecs` option. For example: `gcc cspecExample.c -o cspecExample -lcspec`
* Run it on the console: `./cspecExample`

####¿Are you using Eclipse IDE and it's showing errors all over the project?
You need to add cspec to the project dependencies.
In order to do that, follow these steps...

1. Right click on the project => `Properties`
1. In the right panel go to `C/C++ Build` => `Settings` => `Tool Settings` => `GCC C++ Linker` => `Libraries`
1. In the right pannel, above (`Libraries (-l)`), click on `add` and then write `cspecs`
1. Apply changes
1. Recompile the project

###¿What does CSpecs offer me?
It offers you a set of operations - based on [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) (Ruby), [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/), [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) y [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html) (JavaScript) - that allows you to make [oriented behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (unit and integration code) tests.

##¿How do i use the framework?

###context
Each behaviour to test must be declared within a context. The syntax to define a context is showed below:

```C
context(<identifier>) {
    /* You're inside the context */
}
```
As everything that happens in C, the framework also works in a synchronous way, the code written inside a context is executed sequentially.
Inside a **context**, you can write functions and call them in your tests, you can also include files (.h), define macros and write scenarios - **describes**.

###describe
Each scenario is written inside a **describe**, declared in this way:

```C
describe("Brief description of the scenario") {
    /* Here goes the code */
} end
```

Again, inside a **describe** you can write functions and call from your tests, include files (.h), define macros and write the tests - **its**.

###it

Each **it** represents a test.

```C
it("Brief description of the test") {
    /* Here goes the test code, along with the assertions */
} end
```

Inside it, you have to write the assertions about the behaviour you want to test. In order to do that CSpecs has a set of basic operations to do that - **shoulds**

###should

Each **should** is an assertion, that expects 2 values. The former is the actual value and the latter, the expected one.

```C
should_bool(<actual_boolean>) be equal to(<expected_boolean>);
should_bool(<actual_boolean>) not be equal to(<unexpected_boolean>);

should_char(<caracter_actual>) be equal to(<caracter_esperado>);
should_char(<caracter_actual>) not be equal to(<caracter_no_esperado>);

should_short(<actual_number>) be equal to(<expected_number>);
should_short(<actual_number>) not be equal to(<unexpected_number>);

should_int(<actual_number>) be equal to(<expected_number>);
should_int(<actual_number>) not be equal to(<unexpected_number>);

should_long(<actual_number>) be equal to(<expected_number>);
should_long(<actual_number>) not be equal to(<unexpected_number>);

should_float(<actual_float>) be equal to(<expected_float>);
should_float(<actual_float>) not be equal to(<unexpected_float>);

should_double(<decimal_actual>) be equal to(<decimal_esperado>);
should_double(<decimal_actual>) not be equal to(<decimal_no_esperado>);

should_ptr(<actual_pointer>) be equal to(<expected_pointer>);
should_ptr(<actual_pointer>) not be equal to(<unexpected_pointer>);

should_string(<actual_word>) be equal to(<expected_word>);
should_string(<actual_word>) not be equal to(<unexpected_word>);
```
Also, CSpecs offers [syntactic sugar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) for some of the assertions, like the following examples:

```C
should_bool(<actual_boolean>) be truthy;
should_bool(<actual_boolean>) not be truthy;

should_bool(<actual_boolean>) be falsey;
should_bool(<actual_boolean>) not be falsey;

should_ptr(<actual_pointer>) be null;
should_ptr(<actual_pointer>) not be null;
```

###Hooks - before y after

Sometimes the scenarios, initial configurations, or deallocation of the variables get repeated between tests. In order to handle that, inside each **describe**, you can add
a block code to execute **before** and **after** each test (**it**).

####before
```C
before {
    /* Code to execute before each test */
} end
```

####after
```C
after {
    /* Code to execute after each test */
} end
```

**Note:** As stated before, the context and the describe are executed secuentially, that's why it's __very important__ to remember that the **before** and **after**
must be declared in the beggining of the **describe** scenario, even before the first test.


##Now let's see a complete example, with the execution flow

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <cspecs/cspec.h>

context (complete_example) {

    describe("Describe 1") {

        int *a = NULL,
             b;

        before {
            puts("before 1");
            a = malloc(sizeof(int));
            *a = 10;
            b = 20;
        } end

        after {
            puts("after 1");
            free(a);
            a = NULL;
        } end

        it("*a should be 10 and b should be 20") {
            should_int(*a) be equal to(10);
            should_int(b) be equal to(20);
        } end

        describe("Describe 2") {

            before {
                puts("before 2");
                *a = 30;
                b = 15;
            } end

            after {
                puts("after 2");
                free(a);
                a = NULL;
            } end

            it("*a should be 30 and b should be 15") {
                should_int(*a) be equal to(30);
                should_int(b) be equal to(15);
            } end

            describe("Describe 3") {

                before {
                    puts("before 3");
                    b = 150;
                } end

                after {
                    puts("after 3");
                    free(a);
                    a = NULL;
                } end

                it("*a should be 30 and b should be 150") {
                    should_int(*a) be equal to(30);
                    should_int(b) be equal to(150);
                } end

            } end

        } end

        describe("Describe 4") {

            it("*a should be 10 and b should be 20") {
                should_int(*a) be equal to(10);
                should_int(b) be equal to(20);
            } end

        } end

    } end

}
```
Once the code has been compiled and executed, it'll give us a report of all the tests like the following:

```

  Describe 1
before 1
    ✔ *a should be 10 and b should be 20
after 1
    Describe 2
before 1
before 2
      ✔ *a should be 30 and b should be 15
after 2
after 1
      Describe 3
before 1
before 2
before 3
        ✔ *a should be 30 and b should be 150
after 3
after 2
after 1
    Describe 4
before 1
      ✔ *a should be 10 and b should be 20
after 1


  Summary

  4 success

```

###¿How do i uninstall cspec?
